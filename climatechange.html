    <h1 class = "h1-climate"> What is Climate Change? </h1>
    <p class = "pTag-climate-change">
      Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class = "pTag-climate-change">
      Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is expected to rise.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class = "pTag-climate-change">
      The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class = "h1-climate"> How does Fossil Fuels impact Climate Change? </h1>
    <p class = "pTag-climate-change">
      When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gasses trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming.
    </p>
    <p class = "pTag-climate-change">
      Renewable energy helps climate change because there are so many other ways of producing renewable energy which help the environment and on top of that renewable energy is infinite, unlike fossil fuels.
    </p>
